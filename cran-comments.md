The other three notes relate to a likely bug in miktex (see https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503) that can be ignored,

  Found the following files/directories:

```

a likely issue on the ubuntu and fedora testing machine (see https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/548) that I have no power to fix,
